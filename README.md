# sir_model
Program that simulates the evolution of a pandemic using the SIR model.

The program consists of the design and implementation of a simulation of the spread of an epidemic in a population. A simple theoretical model exists to describe the spread of an epidemic within a closed population. 

The model is called SIR from the initials of:
- Susceptible: the people who can be infected.
- Infected: the people infected and who can infect.
- Removed: people who have recovered, died or are in isolation and can no longer infect or become infected.
A person's state can only go in one direction, first from S to I and then from I to R.

The model shown is by necessity simplified, but it helps to grasp the actual course of an epidemic.
